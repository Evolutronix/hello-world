Here, we present
a groundbreaking innovation
in robotics:
The first walking robot
that moves based on an entirely new
and fundamental principle.
This concept is deeply rooted in the origins
of natural locomotion and
embodies the essence
of how walking movements have evolved
and been refined over time
